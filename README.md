This chrome extension developed to search an english word on Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English Online. I wrote this extension to meet my own needs. When I came across a word I didn't know on the internet,
copying it and then going to Longman's website and pasting it into the search box was not very effective.
What I wanted was to select the word, right-click, and then have the option to search on the longman site appear, just as the search on Google option for "foo" appears.
I managed to do this and after doing it I use it constantly. I am sharing the pictures with you below.
